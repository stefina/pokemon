Location-based Pokémon with Node.js
===========

Pokémon for the GameBoy was one of Nintendos most successful Role Play Games in the late 90s. Even though gaming today is on a different level and can make use of so many new features and possibilities.
The Pokémon-fan base is still big and growing. But why not combining new technology with this game classic and play it on the next level?

As I still love the Pokémon world, I want to talk about how I developed a prototype for a location-based Pokémon Game for Mobile devices with Node.js.



Find out more about this project in my talk at RejectJS which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeJh6NlDVwU

I am still trying to figure out the potential legal issues which I addressed in my talk.
